# UnJorn - Decentralized Social Network
## UnJorn - Hackathon SatsConf 2023 - Social Network for Independent Jornalist

## Our Solution:

UnJorn, the social network, harnesses the power of Nostr and Lightning Network technologies to ensure the ownership and security of independent journalists, enabling them to report on issues such as corruption, war, dictatorship, repression, and more.

The UnJorn social network represents a groundbreaking innovation in the realm of independent journalism, making use of the Nostr and Lightning Network technologies to safeguard the interests and security of autonomous journalists worldwide. Its primary objective is to provide a secure and reliable environment in which these professionals can fulfill their crucial role in disseminating information regarding sensitive topics like corruption, war, dictatorship, and repression.

The Nostr technology plays a pivotal role in decentralizing the UnJorn network, ensuring that it remains free from control by a single entity, government, or corporation. This guarantees that independent journalists can freely and uncensoredly share their reports and opinions, without the risk of content loss due to external interference.

Furthermore, the Lightning Network provides an effective solution to the payment issue. Independent journalists often face challenges in receiving payment for their work in areas where traditional financial institutions may be inaccessible or unreliable. The Lightning Network enables quick and secure payment transactions, ensuring that these professionals receive due recognition for their efforts.

The platform not only focuses on protecting and supporting independent journalists but also on bringing critical and frequently hidden issues to the forefront. By providing a secure environment and a dependable payment structure, this social network empowers these professionals to expose abuses, corruption, and human rights violations, thereby contributing to a more informed and conscious global community.

UnJorn website represents an innovative and necessary response to independent journalism in a rapidly changing world where freedom of expression and truth are essential values. With technologies like Nostr and Lightning Network, it becomes a powerful tool for independent journalists who are willing to risk everything to keep us informed about the most pressing issues of our time.
